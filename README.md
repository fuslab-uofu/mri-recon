## Description 

This repo is for the development of a FUSlab Magnetic Image Resonance (MRI) image reconstruction pipeline. The goals of this pipeline/framework include: 

- To create a uniform "minimum standard" for our FUS lab MRI data that needs to be reconned from raw .dat files from Siemens Scanners
- To give new lab members an accessible starting place for their experimental data processing. 
- Making code publicly available and reproducible is increasingly important for NIH data-reporting requirements.


# Authors
This repo is being compiled by Sam Adams-Tew and Sara Johnson, with iterative feedback from the FUSlab faculty and graduate students. Elements of the code and frameworks are authored by several members of the FUSlab.
